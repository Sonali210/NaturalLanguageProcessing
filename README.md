# Natural Language Processing

# Neural Machine Translation
Discover some of the shortcomings of a traditional seq2seq model and how to solve for them by adding an attention mechanism, then build a Neural Machine Translation model with Attention that translates English sentences into German.

# Text Summarization
Compare RNNs and other sequential models to the more modern Transformer architecture, then create a tool that generates text summaries.

# Question Answering
Explore transfer learning with state-of-the-art models like T5 and BERT, then build a model that can answer questions.

# Chatbot
Examine some unique challenges Transformer models face and their solutions, then build a chatbot using a Reformer model.
